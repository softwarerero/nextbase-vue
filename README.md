This is a little boilerplate application for frontends that rely on
* [Brunch](http://brunch.io): Build tool
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org): UI Framework
* [Asteroid](https://github.com/mondora/asteroid): DDP client to talk to a Meteor backend
* [Unpure](https://github.com/softwarerero/unpure): Unintrusive CSS forked from Pure.css
